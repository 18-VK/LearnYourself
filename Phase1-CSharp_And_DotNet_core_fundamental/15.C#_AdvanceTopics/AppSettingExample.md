# Step-by-step explanation of how to use appsettings.json

For different environments in ASP.NET Core / .NET (6/7/8).

## 1. Default Configuration Files (What & Why)

ASP.NET Core supports environment-specific configuration out of the box.

```text
appsettings.json               → Common settings (shared)
appsettings.Development.json   → Local development
appsettings.Staging.json       → QA / UAT
appsettings.Production.json    → Live / Production
```

**Priority:**

```text
appsettings.Production.json > appsettings.json
```

## 2. Create Configuration Files

Inside your project root:

```text
📁 YourProject
 ├── appsettings.json
 ├── appsettings.Development.json
 ├── appsettings.Production.json
```

## 3. 3️⃣ Set the Environment (MOST IMPORTANT STEP)

ASP.NET Core decides which appsettings file to load using:

e.g. `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`

**Common values:**

- Development
- Staging
- Production

### Option A: Visual Studio (Local Development)

- Right-click project → Properties
- Go to Debug

Set:

```text
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = Development
```

> 📌 By default, Visual Studio sets this to `Development`

### Option B: launchSettings.json

**File location:**

```text
Properties/launchSettings.json
```

**Example:**

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "YourProject": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option C: Windows (Production Server)

cmd:

```cmd
setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Production"
```

Restart IIS / App.

### Option D: Linux / Docker

cmd:

```bash
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
```

## 4. How ASP.NET Core Loads These Files (Internals)

In .NET 6+ (`Program.cs`), this is automatic:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

Behind the scenes it does:

- Load `appsettings.json`
- Load `appsettings.{Environment}.json`
- Load environment variables

👉 You do NOT need to write any extra code

## 5. Read Values from appsettings.json

**Example: Read Connection String**

```csharp
var connection = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
```

# Tips

**What NOT to Do ❌**

- ❌ Do not hardcode connection strings
- ❌ Do not commit production secrets to Git
- ❌ Do not manually switch JSON files

- ✔ Use environment variable
- ✔ Use secret manager / Azure Key Vault (later stage)

# Do I need to rebuild app with diff environment variable value for each?

**Ans:** NO — you do NOT need to rebuild the app for different environment values.

# How ASP.NET Core Actually Works

ASP.NET Core reads the environment at runtime, not at build time.

`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is read when the app starts, and based on that:

`appsettings.{Environment}.json` is loaded automatically.

**Meaning:**

- ✔ Same build
- ✔ Same binaries
- ✔ Different environment values
- ✔ Different behavior

**Then deploy the same build to:**

```text
Development
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development

Staging
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging

Production
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
```

👉 The app automatically switches config files.

Only environment variables & config change — not the build.

**Common Confusion: DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT vs ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT**

| Variable               | Used For              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT | Web apps              |
| DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT     | Console / Worker apps |

# WinForms / Console Apps (Important for You)

Even non-web apps behave the same:

```csharp
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{environment}.json", optional: true);
```

**Environment value:**

```cmd
setx DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT Development
```

👉 Still no rebuild needed

# If I set environment variable in windows edit environment variable?

## Where to Set the Environment Variable in Windows

**Option 1️⃣ System-wide (Most common for servers)**

- Press `Win + R` → `sysdm.cpl`
- Advanced tab → Environment Variables
- Under System variables → New
- Add:

```text
Name  : ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT
Value : Production
```

- Click OK

> **Important:**
> You must restart the application process (IIS / app / service) for it to take effect.

# How to Verify It's Working

In code:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(app.Environment.EnvironmentName);
```

# Common Mistakes (Very Important)

## ❌ 1. App still using old environment

✔ You forgot to restart IIS / app

## 2. Using wrong variable name

| App Type         | Correct Variable         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| ASP.NET Core Web | `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` |
| Console / Worker | `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT`     |

## 3. Visual Studio overrides it

`launchSettings.json` has:

```json
"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
```

Visual Studio wins over Windows env variables.

# Important

**Production Best Practice**

For Production:

- Use System variables
- Do NOT rely on user variables
- Avoid `launchSettings.json`

# Interview-Ready Answer

Yes, setting `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` through Windows environment variables is valid. The application reads it at
startup, so only a restart is required, not a rebuild.
